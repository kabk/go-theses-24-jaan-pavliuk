								From Drexciya to David Guetta, from Paradise Garage to

								symbiotic, equal role. A feedback loop of sound and meaning,
								reverberating through the communal body, conjures fictional
								worlds that accompany club nights, festivals, releases, and many
								other aspects of electronic music as a whole. It turns and
								tumbles.

								Fast forward 7 years, I am here, writing this. In those years, I
								have been an active participant in the "scene” surrounding
								electronic music. Now, I am referring back to where it all
								started, this feeling of hyperreality, a sense of traveling
								without arriving. New questions have risen, more precisely
								concerning the cultural dimensions of the genre, particularly
								the role of fictional narratives in shaping the perceptions
								within the broader electronic music culture.
							</p>

							<p>
								The central question guiding my research is: How are fictional
								narratives utilized in electronic music, and how has this
								utilization changed in time? To explore this question, I use a
								mixed-methods approach that combines analysis of electronic
								music history and narratives with personal findings and
								observations, implicating how clubbing and partaking in the
								culture itself can serve as a method for research. By looking at
								literature concerning the genre, analyzing and examining aspects
								such as album artwork, events and music within, and applying
								ideas of existing cultural theory to the topic I aim to uncover
								why fictional narratives manifest within electronic music,
								change in time, and in turn, shape the culture around it.
								Additionally, personal observations and experiences will provide
								valuable insights into the more active role and impact on
								community identity and participation.

						Tracing the History of Fiction and Reality in Dance Music
					</h2>

					<p class="first">
						Electronic music is a wide spectrum. For the sake of and clarity of
						my own research, it is imperative to create a framework for further
						reference, specifically on the terms of the music written about, and
						what I specifically consider fiction or the imaginary.
					</p>
					<p>
						I will not be talking about electronic dance music as just an
						overreaching genre which employs electronic musical instruments,
						digital instruments, or circuitry-based technology in its creation —
						I am dealing with specifically electronic music that is created with
						an intent to be danced to, experienced in the space of a nightclub,
						rave, festival – and is generally produced for playback by DJ-s that
						are narrating the musical experience of the night itself. Of course,
						electronic dance music is in essence a category reaching back to the
						60s and 70s with artists such as Kraftwerk and Silver Apples, but I
						am choosing to focus on the electronic dance music onwards from the
						creation of genres such as house and techno, which got its starting
						point in the late 80s, and propelled EDM<span
							class="reference-toggle"
							>(+)</span
						><span class="reference">
							I honestly despise the term EDM. Even though it quite literally
							stands for Electronic Dance Music, it has been watered down and
							connotated with some dude-bro-candy-raver stature prevalent in
							contemporary American music festivals. Why do all good things have
							to turn bad?
						</span>
						as we know it into a broader, worldwide notoriety.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now as for fiction and fictional narratives — what I consider to
						precede fiction (and being interchangeable with it) is imagination,
						and therefore I would like to inform the reader on what kind of
						definition of imaginary I will be working with. In commonsense
						English, the term imaginary is a conception that is a conscious
						mental image — stemming from Jacques Lacan. ’The imaginary’ is
						Lacan's term for an internal, introspective representation of the
						visual world, in which the construction of the self as subject is
						initiated. <sup>1</sup> I would denounce that, and instead shift my
						focus on Édouard Glissant, whose definition of the imaginary I find
						more appealing and wider-reaching than the oftentimes limiting
						language of Lacan. For Glissant, the imaginary is aIl the ways a
						culture has of perceiving and conceiving of the world.
						<sup>2</sup> Hence, every human culture will have its own particular
						imaginary. This differentiation is useful, as the imaginaries and
						fictional aspects of different cultures are as worth noting, indeed,
						different — structured by upbringing, collective experiences and
						memory. This is to bring to light the fact that the imaginary
						lexicon and frame of culture surrounding dance music, is something
						that stands out from the broader cultural landscape.<span
							class="reference-toggle"
							>(+)</span
						><span class="reference">
							This is something I have personally noticed quite early on since
							being involved in the culture so called. I honestly (and
							regrettably) was quite a right-leaning person politically in my
							younger years, up til the point when I got more involved with
							electronic music and its frame of mind. Through partying and
							talking to people I had many points of realization which led to
							conclusion of “wow, you can actually think about convictions and
							beliefs in a completely different way”. This concerns gender
							norms, goals, religious views, and any other topic that can stir
							up a storm at an otherwise friendly family dinner.
						</span>
						In the context of the genre, the imaginary and fictional emerges as
						distinctive and multifaceted, reflecting the collective experiences,
						memories, and aspirations of its participants.
					</p>
					<h3 id="chapter-1">Beginnings</h3>
					<p class="first">
						As electronic dance music in its essential form has more prevalence
						in Europe than in any other part of the world (Klancnik, 2019) I
						would like to pivot the attention away from the current epicentre
						and focus on the beginnings of contemporary “Techno” or “EDM” as we
						know it. Its origins lay in the community of Detroit, playing a very
						important role in African American history — created out of a
						response to the urban decay that was affecting Detroit and other
						various cities around the United States in the late 1980s, Techno as
						a genre is evidence of a post-civil rights movement youth of color,
						creating a space for themselves in the more industrialized northern
						states of the US. (Brown, 2020)
					</p>
					<p>
						Detroit techno was born just as Motor City began to die.
						<a href="#figure_1" class="fig">(Fig 1)</a>
						This music was a creation of intellect, a contemporary methodology
						of Black expression that transformed the African American musical
						heritage into a modernized, technologically advanced and optimized
						form of soul music, that was innately rooted in resistance,
						futuristic fiction, and an uphill fight against oppression. (Brown,
						2020)
					</p>

					</figure>
					<p>
						As for the term itself, "Techno" with its beginnings rooted in the
						complexities of societal shifts, captures the essence of a genre
						born from the need to navigate an era marked by the
						deindustrialization of North American cities and technological
						evolution. British author Simon Reynolds’ account traces the word's
						emergence to 1980s Germany, gaining prominence in 1988 with the
						release of the compilation "Techno! The New Dance Sound of Detroit"
						<a href="#figure_2" class="fig">(Fig 2)</a> linking it specifically
						to the electronic dance music emerging from Detroit at the time.

					<p>
						However, the origin story takes a different outlook when we look to
						Juan Atkins, a part of the world-renowned Underground Resistance
						collective.<span class="reference-toggle">(+)</span
						><span class="reference">
							 Detroit techno collective founded in 1990, renowned for their
							heavy-use of fiction, and militant political, anti-corporate
							ethos. I remember first stumbling upon their work while browsing
							YouTube in the late hours of the night while procrastinating my
							math homework for the next day. Oh how nice were the easier days
							of high school. The track was Maurizio - Ploy (UR mix)
							<a href="#figure_4" class="fig">(Fig 4)</a>, an astonishing 11
							minute techno track that starts off with an orchestral,
							semi-ambient arrangement that gets interrupted by vocal samples of
							“eh” and shuffling hi-hats, and before you notice it a sureway
							ascension in energy drifts along. A hypnotic drive into the
							deepest parts of any dispersed constellation of your choice. Quite
							an achievement I must admit, taking Maurizio's track and
							transforming into an epic Detroit techno classic, which walks a
							very fine line between soulful and moving, dance floor friendly
							while retaining that totally outer worldly, intergalactic feel
							Underground Resistance could deliver back in the day.
						</span>
						<a href="#figure_3" class="fig">(Fig 3)</a> Atkins encountered the
						term "Techno" in Alvin Toffler's book "The Third Wave" (1980), a
						sequel to Toffler's influential work "Future Shock" (1979).
						Toffler's exploration delved into the mental states of societies
						grappling with the repercussions of rapid change within a short
						timeframe. Atkins, influenced by Toffler's conceptualization of
						societal shifts, seized the term as a fitting description for the
						emerging electronic sound. (Brown, 2020)

					</figure>
					<p>
						This connection between the term "Techno" and futuristic thinking is
						not merely linguistic; it signifies a shift in how people perceived
						and interacted with music. The artistry of Techno characterized an
						idealized outcome for the future, while also offering a critique of
						the contemporary American urban life exemplified in manufacturing
						cities as the aforementioned Detroit. At the heart of the emergence
						of the subculture were advancements in computer technologies,
						allowing musicians to challenge the norms of traditional music
						genres. This contrasted sharply with the beliefs of contemporary
						theorists (Edelman, 1995), who predicted that technological progress
						would supplant art; instead, the technological evolution became a
						stand-alone, living and compelling art form in its own right.
					</p>
					<p>
						The societal anxiety and uncertainty stemming from
						deindustrialization and the surge in technological progress created
						a demand for a musical form that mirrored the systematic,
						technological nature of the changes taking place. "Techno" not only
						became a genre label but also a symbol of the profound impact of
						societal and cultural shifts on artistic expression, providing a
						sonic landscape that both reflected and responded to the challenges
						and opportunities presented by the evolving material reality.
					</p>
					<p>
						This conditioning is the sole base of origin to the EDM subculture.
						Most accounts situate it as a dissident group whose subcultural
						values were inherent to resistance, and against the more streamlined
						and capitalistic culture of the very American, achievement based
						mindset. From here, I would start to consider the meaning of
						subculture to change into a counter-culture, as the direct
						opposition to the higher powers of political status quo. While EDM
						was on its uprise, so was the war on drugs, unemployment rates,
						white flight and laws whose sole intent was to restrict. While
						success was being determined by economic gain, EDM embraced a
						culture of hedonism and excess. If the dominant society could be
						described as dull, meticulously structured, and excessively formal,
						then the EDM scene can be depicted as vibrant, playful, and
						disordered—a direct opposition to the prevailing environment, and
						for these reasons a form of resistance.
					</p>
					<p>
						Taking into account the rapidly changing situation of daily life, a
						culture of resistance and the emergence of technologies which gave
						new ways to produce electronic music, many artists took a bold,
						experimental and boundary pushing approach to their work. I can not
						proceed writing this without mentioning Underground Resistance with
						their militant and strictly anti-corporate ethos, The Belleville
						Three who created Detroit Techno and paved the way to all and any
						kinds of dance music we know today, and the Chicago sound pioneers
						Ron Hardy, Larry Levan and Frankie Knuckles who dedicated their life
						to preaching house and disco music to the minority and queer people
						of the Northern states.
					</p>
					<p>
						For the sake of being constrained, I will have to turn my focus
						point on the enigmatic and deeply influential electronic
						worldbuilding duo of Drexciya, consisting of James Stinson and
						Gerald Donald. But before that, just to provide some intricacy on
						how fiction manifested itself in the dance music scene in Detroit, I
						will introduce a label description from Mike Himes' “90s' Guide to
						the Detroit Underground” Pamphlet, concerning the aforementioned
						collective of Underground Resistance, which Gerald Donald and James
						Stintson also happened to be a part of.
					</p>
					<p class="quote">
						“RESISTANCE IS A LABEL FOR A MOVEMENT. A MOVEMENT THAT WANTS CHANGE
						BY SONIC REVOLUTION. WE URGE YOU TO JOIN THE RESISTANCE AND HELP US
						TO COMBAT THE MEDIOCRE AUDO AND VISUAL PROGRAMMING THAT IS BEING FED
						TO THE INHABITANTS OF EARTH, THIS PROGRAMMING IS STAGNATING THE

					<h3 id="chapter-1">Case Study: Drexciya</h3>
					<p class="first">
						To provide context and background before we dive in to the Drexciyan
						depths, I wish to give quotes from Alvin Toffler and James Stinson
						to illustrate the frame in which they operated. These two writings
						convey very precisely the overarching ideology to the Drexciyan
						myth.
					</p>
					<p class="quote">
						“The push into the depths of the sea provides us with a miror image
						of the drive into outer space, and lays the basis for the third
						cluster of the new techno-sphere. The first historic wave of social
						change on earth came when our ancestor ceased to rely on foraging
						and hunting, and began instead to domesticate animals and cultivate
						the soil. We are now precisely at this stage in our relationship to
						the seas” - Alvin Toffler, The Third Wave. 1980
					</p>
					<p class="quote">
						“The inspiration for the underwater world came from deep inside my
						mind. God gave me this vision and I’m building up on it bringing it
						to life of the whole world to see…. Water is life. Life started on
						this planet and other planets due to water. It is the cutting edge
						of creativity and innovation. You have billions of different species
						in the seas, oceans, lakes, ponds and streams across the world.
						Millions of species still have not been discovered by man so is that
						the cutting edge of creativity or what? We approach our music the
						same way…” – James Stinson
					</p>
					<p class="first">
						And now, to give an overview of the Drexciyan myth itself, here is
						the first mention of the Drexciyan Mythology, explained in the liner
						notes of their release titled “The Quest” (1997)
						<a href="#figure_5" class="fig">(Fig 5)</a>

						“Could it be possible for humans to breath underwater? A foetus in
						its mothers womb is certainly alive in an aquatic environment.<br /><br />
						During the greatest holocaust the world has ever known, pregnant
						America-bound African slaves were thrown overboard by the thousands
						during labour for being sick and disruptive cargo. Is it possible
						that they could have given birth at sea to babies that never needed
						air? <br /><br />Recent experiments have shown mice able to breathe
						liquid oxygen. Even more shocking and conclusive was a recent
						instance of a premature infant saved from certain death by breathing
						liquid oxygen through its undeveloped lungs. These facts combined
						with reported sightings of Gillmen and swamp monsters in the coastal
						swamps of the South-Eastern United States make the slave trade
						theory startlingly feasible. <br /><br />Are Drexciyans water
						breathing, aquatically mutated descendants of those unfortunate
						victims of human greed? have they been spared by God to teach us or
						terrorise us? Did they migrate from the Gulf of Mexico to the

						This is Drexciya <a href="#figure_6" class="fig">(Fig 6)</a>. A
						Detroit techno-electro duo, first conceived in 1989. Drexciya's
						James Stinson and Gerald Donald stayed hidden behind their alias for
						much of their active existence, developing a complex personal
						mythology of a "Drexciyan" race of underwater humans. This was one
						of Drexciyas most powerful ways of creating fiction — by being so
						hidden away from anything that could be considered publicity.
						(Stinson rarely if ever granted interviews, and his partner Donald
						went even further, maintaining an exceptionally low public profile
						that fellow Detroit artist Daniel Bell described as "very surreal.”)

						They left their actions in the shadows: The listener does not solve
						the mystery, nor does he crack the codes. They only pass it on -
						leaving space to project a plethora of desires and fiction onto
						them, imbuing the myth deeply into the mind of the listener. Being a
						fan of Drexciya, the listener is actively partaking in the creation
						of the narrative by creating their own meanings and connections in
						the gaps left unfilled. Within this fictional world, their music -
						was imagined as an dimensional portal between their black roots and
						the contemporary life in the United States.
					</p>
					<p>
						Their unapologetically political and urgent approach of “Total
						Concept” as James Stinson called it, is a meticulously engineered
						and designed schematic of a world of operation, where every detail
						and image is a part of a larger system of fiction. A toolbox of the
						imaginary, fuelled by their culture, and their own perception of
						their surroundings. Writer Greg Tate (2007) describes their
						imaginary as a reinterpretation of the Middle Passage, viewing it as
						a space of possibility, rather than destruction.
					</p>

					<p>
						This world has ignited the creativity of numerous artists, writers,
						and filmmakers such as Kodwo Eshun, Dominique White, Andrea Chung,
						Gosub, Aphex Twin and many more - giving rise to a diverse range of
						speculative narrations and explorations that extend wide beyond the
						electronic music community. Yet, the influence of Drexciya on
						specifically electronic music is in my opinion, unparalleled —
						creating an everlasting impact of how musical artistry and myth can
						be in such eloquent dialogue. When Underground Resistance was taking
						inspiration from Space, Drexciya went underwater. When Underground
						Resistance introduced a political subconscious to the dancefloor,
						Drexciya added a reminder of slavery, the original sin of America.

						Their last album was Grava 4.
						<a href="#figure_8" class="fig">(Fig 8)</a> Released in 2002, which
						was also the last year Drexciya produced music, as James Stinson
						sadly passed away. With the release of their last album, Drexciya
						left not only a theoretical and fictional mark on the world, but a
						very real, tangible trace in the solar system. In fact, they
						purchased a star, and named it Grava 4, creating the last link in
						their mythology, rooting their imaginary in a real, existing place.
						As noted by Afrofuturist Kodwo Ashun: “Drexciya granted themselves
						the imperial right to nominate and colonize interstellar space” —
						their fiction thus was a weapon, and in time became real.

					<p>
						From the deep seas, to the wider cosmos, the Drexciyan myth came to
						a bittersweet end. This end left behind a legacy. What Hegel
						described as “Zeitgeist”, “spirit of the age”, “daemon” or in
						general, and invisible agent that defines the characteristics of a
						given time in history, is exactly what Drexciya achieved. Paving a
						way for their peers and future generations to approach their craft
						in electronic music as something way bigger than just hedonistic
						excess and consumption.
					</p>
					<p>
						This goes to show that fiction and electronic dance music go hand in
						hand—already from the early days on. Countless releases and events,
						no matter the specific style, have always had a tinge on something
						imaginary, something not quite real in their repertoire. Fiction is
						a tool, and this very tool has been in the hands of the creators of
						electronica since day zero.
					</p>

					<h2 id="chapter-2">The Spectacular Culture</h2>

					<p class="first">
						But what does this tool imply nowadays? Now as we have an outlook on
						the history of electronic music and an example of one of the most
						prominent acts and their creative output, we can continue to the
						more modern implication of fictional narratives in electronic music,
						or rather, what has been left of them
					</p>
					<p>
						For this specific task, I will take into account the basis of
						fictional narratives in electronic dance music as performative
						acts<span class="reference-toggle">(+)</span
						><span class="reference">
							Having had the experience of being in roles both of the performer
							and the audience, both roles are in my opinion partaking in a
							performance, in a form of dialogue and also separately, in a more
							monological sense. This was noticed by me when while playing
							music, I realized that my movements are something that I would not
							ever do in a setting of dancing or listening to a DJ set, and vice
							versa. A social aspect comes into play too, as both dancers and
							the performer have an audience of the people surrounding — the
							club is a spectacle, not only as a singular part, but every
							partaker becomes a spectacle watched by others in the space.
						</span>
						(as electronic dance music is in its essence revolving around
						consumption of the means, with an audience and a performer) which do
						inherently differ in context depending on the time and intent. This
						contextualization and timeline is important, as electronic dance
						music has gone through a massive transformation from its beginnings
						to now contemporary times.
					</p>
					<p>
						I would argue that the most appropriate definition of progress in
						the electronic dance music culture would be its shift from an
						underground, obscure subculture into a fully fledged culture
						industry. By the term culture industry, I mean the idea developed by
						Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer in their 1947 work "Dialectic of
						Enlightenment.”, where they proposed that contemporary popular
						culture is akin to a factory producing standardized cultural goods.
					</p>

					<p>
						This is important as to argue, how using fictional narratives as
						resistance techniques by electronic dance music subculturalists
						would also help shape it into a corporately organized culture
						industry. Adorno and Rabinbach (1975) had later on pointed out that
						culture industries rarely create their own products and colonize
						earlier forms of art for mass audiences instead (this being taking
						influence from the early days of Detroit techno and fiction). As EDM
						subculture moved toward becoming a culture industry the minor
						semblances of fictional narrative used as resistance that made it
						once attractive became what Horkheimer and Adorno (1944/1969)
						referred to as pseudo-individualization—which are the superficial
						features that provide consumers with an ‘authentic’ experience.
					</p>

					<p>
						As to what Is an ‘authentic’ experience in the electronic music
						adjacent territories is hard to argue without falling into pitfalls
						of nostalgia and somber “old-headery”, for the lack of the better
						term. But as my practice and my personal taste in graphic design and
						electronic music is very deeply influenced by this nostalgia, I will
						deliberately take this fall headfirst, and to stay on the line with
						my research, I will consider the authentic experience of fiction as
						something rooted in resistance and intent, rather than something
						purely of excess and profit.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now, to make it short — to directly contrast the approach of
						Drexciya while seeing how their methodology and inspiration of using
						fiction as resistance has changed in contemporary times, I believe
						we have to be global and urgent, almost too straightforward. To make
						it very obvious, there is no better fictional gathering or concept
						that showcases what I consider the rotten apple of EDM culture
						better than the Belgian festival called “Tomorrowland”
					</p>
					<h3 id="chapter-1">The Land of Tomorrow</h3>
					<p class="first">
						Tomorrowland <a href="#figure_9" class="fig">(Fig 9)</a> is one of
						the most well-known electronic dance music festivals in the world,
						held at De Schorre public recreational park in Boom, Belgium.
						Attended by close to 500 thousand people, and includes a yearly,
						fictional thematic from the year 2011 onwards. The previous themes
						have been: “Masker”, “The Story of Planaxis”, “The Tree of Life” and
						my personal favorite, “The Book of Wisdom: The Return”.
						<a href="#figure_10" class="fig">(Fig 10)</a>

						</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>
						As to why I consider Tomorrowland important enough for a comparison
						with Drexciya, is the sole reason that Tomorrowland checks two very
						important boxes: One: It being based on fiction and myth, similar to
						the method of Drexciya, and two: It is a direct continuation, yet
						contrast to the initial wave of the rave revolution of the early
						90s.
					</p>
					<p>
						Approximately twenty years after the inception of Drexciya, a new
						commercialized form of dance music emerged globally, gaining
						significant traction among millennials. Joshua Erenstein, a
						co-founder of the LEDM (Your Link to Electronic Dance Music) group,
						told Forbes in 2014:
					</p>
					<p class="quote">
						“Electronic Dance Music provides a new sound, a fresh energy, and a
						clean space that needed the attention of the youth generation in
						order to bring it to prominence”
					</p>
					<p>
						Erenstein suggested that millennials, raised amidst the era of
						social media, live completely online, where electronic music could
						flourish as contagious content, disconnected from its origins in
						Detroit and the historical lineage of British hardcore continuum.
					</p>
					<p>
						The observation is intriguing because the direct correlation between
						the fantastical realm of Tomorrowland and earlier forms of
						electronic music remains uncertain: while technological advancements
						and media saturation blur preceding contexts, there persists a
						connection through the overarching structure and consumption of the
						music, alongside the influence of fictional narratives.
					</p>
					<p>
						To see how Tomorrowland uses fiction, one does not need to seek far
						and wide — it has even been considered as the “Disneyland of music
						festivals”. Their imaginary is mainly based off of medieval-tinged
						narratives, most often used to sell products and tickets related to
						the event, and to use fantastical aesthetics as decoration and
						spectacle for their festival. From books with titles such as “The
						Rise of Adscendo”
						<a href="#figure_11" class="fig">(Fig 11)</a> which give insight to
						the tale of Tomorrowland, to concept art of the logos and various
						fictional elements that are related to their imaginary. None of it
						really serves a purpose of intent, but rather is optimized to fit a
						relatively unoffensive and safe narrative of “The positive energy
						the festival stands for”
					</p>
					<figure id="figure_11">
						<img src="images/adsce1.png" alt="Description of the image" />

						<figcaption>

					</figure>
					<p>
						If Drexciya used fiction as a tool for social and political
						resistance, reacting against oppressive systems they witnessed, then
						it could be argued that Tomorrowland utilizes fiction as a general
						disavowal of reality for profit, stemming from the soaring financial
						growth in speculative digital economies and the euphoric, hedonistic
						escapism of the new content industrialization of electronic dance
						music. The global spread of electronic music sparked an imagined
						collective utopia, which was eventually commodified and diluted,
						assimilating into the global music industry and economy, reaching a
						tipping point and plummeting into the realm of the culture industry.
					</p>
					<p>
						But this comes as no surprise in the modern age — electronic dance
						music is not a singular case of commodification and
						industrialization disconnected from all the other cultural spheres,
						be it film, theatre, literature or even the beloved graphic design
						that I myself partake in even more on the daily basis than
						electronic music. This shift is brought upon by the capitalist
						creation of new psychological needs and wants, which sadly, can only
						be met and satisfied by the products of capitalism itself. A vicious
						cycle. Yet again, it turns and tumbles.
					</p>

					<h2 id="chapter-3">Conclusion: Destination Unknown</h2>

					<p class="first">
						Where does this circular motion pull us? What future can we envision
						nowadays? When the originators were writing tracks of Interviews
						with aliens, joining the future, and fuel for the fire to attend the
						riot, it can seem that nowadays there is space left only for purely
						commercial and fabricate-for-gain fictional narratives that serve no
						one but the profiteer.

					<p>But to be honest, this is a hugely defeatist stance.</p>
					<p>
						It would be wrong of me to say that all is lost, there is nothing
						left and “It’s All Gone Pete Tong”. Fictional narratives in
						electronic dance music (or in any other creative field) change in
						time and intent, and to consider their commodification something
						unbelievable or not natural is a pitfall ridden with pessimism, that
						I oftentimes take a deep look at, and eventually turn my gaze to the
						many other projects and artists who are still pushing boundaries,
						creating work that resonates with the time we live in, and are
						passionate about the sphere in more ways than just creating
						spectacle for the sake of monetary sale. .
					</p>
					<p>
						Where do we go from here? Being in the position that I am in, and
						having done the research for this thesis, new pathways of knowledge
						and understanding have opened, which help me to give sense to my
						beloved sphere of work and practice. With this newfound knowledge, I
						can only speculate that we have passed a tipping point where a
						future in the context of the imaginary of electronic music is up to
						debate, and the old ways of fiction have gone to rest.
					</p>
					<p>
						While the old is in slumber, PC Music, Year0001, Perlon, Posh
						Isolation and many more labels and artists in recent years are still
						creating and paving a way for fiction and concept to flourish in
						ways not seen before, to contrast the commodified structures of the
						music industry’s darker side. The imaginary of electronic dance
						music culture is alive, just in many more ways than before. As it
						seems, there is simply no need to imagine a future the way it was
						done before, as the toolbox of imaginary eventually became
						attractive to outsiders to negate the initial intentions.
					</p>
					<p>
						With all of this being up for debate, it leaves me excited for
						future research into this topic. As my practice very often concerns
						fiction and fantasy, and I consider myself a quite imaginative
						person, I am fantasizing about a future where within the ongoing
						commodification of fantasy, there is a possibility of a renaissance
						for fictional narratives. A new question rises: “How can we detour
						the fictional narratives and aesthetics of Tomorrowland as a
						practice of resistance?”
					</p>
					<p>
						But for now, “Let’s Dream of a Brighter World”.
